# Project Rewind: Determining Binary Sentiment
For the Hackathon we're running this afternoon, I chose an NLP problem: train a model to determine binary sentiment of movie reviews from an IMDB dataset. 

The IMDB dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) and includes "25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing." 

This analyses is divided into 5 steps, with corresponding notebooks found in the /code file.

 1. Cleaning
 2. EDA
 3. Test model
 4. MultinomialNB and RandomForestClassifier models
 5. Keras model (if time permits)
